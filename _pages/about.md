I'm a scientist, writer, and educator working on a PhD in glaciology at the [Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory](https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/) under [Jonny Kingslake](http://www.jkingslake.com/). I'm a co-founder of [Cycle for Science](www.cycleforscience.org) along with [Rachel Woods-Robinson](https://twitter.com/rachelectron?lang=en). My personal website can be found [here](www.elizabethcase.github.io).

I'd love to chat about any ideas, questions, conversations or recommendations -- elizabethhcase [at] gmail.com.
