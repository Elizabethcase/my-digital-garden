Hello! So happy you've found your way to this experiment. I'm [Elizabeth Case](/about){: .internal-link}. This [digital garden](/digitalgardens){: .internal-link} follows the roots of many others [1](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) [2](https://nadiaeghbal.com/) [3](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880).  I'm initially trying to grow three gardens:

+ One, generally, [about thinking, writing, reading, and living](/birdseyeview){: .internal-link}

+ A second, [related to my research](/researchoverview){: .internal-link}

+ A third, based on a seminar on [Race, Environmental Justice, and Climate Change](/race_ej_cc_seminar/syllabusrejcc){: .internal-link} that I helped organize in Fall 2020

+ (temp link to [firn/gpr project](/FirnGPRProjWNanna/MainQuestions){: .internal-link})

+ (temp link to [plausible magic writing class](/plausiblemagic/main){: .internal-link})

+ (temp link to [October 2020 political actions](/PoliticalActionOct2020/landingpage){: .internal-link})

+ LInk to [Pond Notes](/pondnotes/landingpage){: .internal-link}, daily observations over six weeks of a eutrophic pond in upstate new york

I'm mostly using this as a way to deposit notes, drafts, and thoughts that could use a conversation or connection to deepen or expand. A lot of folks smarter than me have [a lot of thoughts on good note-taking](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be), but I'm also interested in leaving quotes as whole posts, in dead-ends that require backtracking, and in links to writing that say it better than I ever could. I'm thinking of this garden as a generative writing tool, a memory bank, and a different mode of linking research topics together. Please reach out to me if you'd like to chat about anything on here -- I'm on twitter at [elizabeth_case](https://www.twitter.com/elizabeth_case), and I have a more [traditional website](https://elizabethcase.github.io/).

For some art/people/newsletters/links I love, check out my ever-evolving [recommendation list](/linklist){: .internal-link}, or for a daily-ish log of impressions, here's [a list of links I've been clicking](/lookedattoday){: .internal-link}.

If you'd like to start your own, this [digital garden](/digitalgardens){: .internal-link} is mostly the work of [Maxime Vaillancourt](https://maximevaillancourt.com/) and he wrote a [great guide for how to set one up](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll). Happy to share any gardening tips if you decide to plant your own.
