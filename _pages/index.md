# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

Hello! So happy you've found your way to this experiment. I'm [Elizabeth Case](/about){: .internal-link}. This digital garden follows the roots of many others following many others [1]() [2]().  I'm initially trying to grow two gardens:

One, generally, [about thinking, writing, reading, and living](../_notes/birdseyeview){: .internal-link}

A second, about my research (_coming soon_)

I'm mostly using this as a way to deposit notes, drafts, and thoughts that could use a conversation to deepen or expand. I'm thinking of this garden as a generative writing tool, a memory bank, and different mode of connecting research topics together. Please reach out to me if you'd like to chat about anything on here -- I'm on twitter at [elizabeth_case](www.twitter.com/elizabeth_case).

For some art/people/newsletters/links I love, check out my ever-evolving [link list](../_notes/linklist)

If you'd like to start your own, this garden is mostly the work of [Maxime Vaillancourt] and he wrote a [great guide for how to set one up](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll)
