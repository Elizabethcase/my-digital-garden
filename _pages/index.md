# Welcome! ðŸŒ±

Hello! So happy you've found your way to this experiment. I'm [Elizabeth Case](/about){: .internal-link}. This digital garden follows the roots of many others following many others [1](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) [2](https://nadiaeghbal.com/) [3](https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880).  I'm initially trying to grow two gardens:

One, generally, [about thinking, writing, reading, and living](/birdseyeview){: .internal-link}

A second, [related to my research](/researchoverview)

I'm mostly using this as a way to deposit notes, drafts, and thoughts that could use a conversation or connection to deepen or expand. A lot of folks smarter than me have [a lot of thoughts on good note-taking](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z3SjnvsB5aR2ddsycyXofbYR7fCxo7RmKW2be), but I'm also interested in leaving quotes as whole posts, in dead-ends that require backtracking, and in links to writing that say it better than I ever could. I'm thinking of this garden as a generative writing tool, a memory bank, and different mode of linking research topics together. Please reach out to me if you'd like to chat about anything on here -- I'm on twitter at [elizabeth_case](www.twitter.com/elizabeth_case), and I have a more [traditional website](www.elizabethcase.github.io).

For some art/people/newsletters/links I love, check out my ever-evolving [link list](/linklist)

If you'd like to start your own, this garden is mostly the work of [Maxime Vaillancourt](https://maximevaillancourt.com/) and he wrote a [great guide for how to set one up](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll). Happy to share any gardening tips if you decide to set one up.
