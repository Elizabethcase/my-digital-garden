title: Firn & ice lens observations & implications within dense GPR grid
---

## Goal for the Week: Generate a hypothesis about ice lens (formation, distribution) in dense survey at Camp Recovery

### Main Questions

1. How are ice lenses distributed, and what drives this distribution?
2. How does the distribution vary given topography, accumulation, and any other microweather/microtopographic signals?
3. Can we use a machine learning algorithm to pick out ice lenses?
4. (How are ice lenses distributed relative to summer surfaces?)

To do this, we looked at two datasets collected by GEUS at Camp Recovery in 2018, as well as the output of MAR, a regional climate model. 

- [Target 5 Snow and Firn Core](/FirnGPRProjWNanna/Target5CoreDensity){: .internal-link} (density validation)
- [Target 5 Radar Grid ](/FirnGPRProjWNanna/radardata){: .internal-link}
- [MAR output](/FirnGPRProjWNanna/MAROutput){: .internal-link}
