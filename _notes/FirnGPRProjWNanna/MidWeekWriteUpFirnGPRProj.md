Time series shows low smb due to low snowfall in 2016. We can see the 2016 summer surface. 2015 is obscured, though small possibility it could be surface seen just below 2016 
- [ ] do back of envelope – how close together could 2016 and 2015 summer surfaces be given compaction + melt

ice core at target 5 shows some ice lenses, although none are terribly thick
total ice = 36 cm

think this represents 2014 - 2017 (?)
mass_water = mass_ice
mass_ice (in 1x1km square, if this is representative) = $360 mmie * 1km^2 * 900 kg/m³$
mmwe = $360mmie∗900kg/m³/1000$ = 324 mmwe
mass_water = melt -runoff
