I've found that my identity is almost entirely ungrounded – no religion, culture, traditions or family history to fall back on.

Religion – jewish? but never really raised in or to know the faith, or its traditions.

Culture – i was kept separate from the (competition? race? striving?) culture of my home; parents that were part of but arms-length-from those … habits? 

Traditions – both parents grew up in households that moved around a lot… they did not have traditions, so we didn't either? vague christmas. vague hanukah. we did almost nothing on a regular basis.

Family history – grandpa case rejected, then was rejected from, his family; judy rejected her family after many disowned her, then we lost touch with her sister, she also distanced herself from being japanese; maga - came from a household with all kinds of issues (father on his own at 10? reina leaving her kids again and again? enid marrying dick.. and her kids also seemed to be distant? maga marrying distant abusive men?); poppy, i don't know. 

So all the normal shapers of identity – I don't have that. How do you know if you belong, when you don't know who you are? What kinds of freedom does this offer me? What is my identity?
