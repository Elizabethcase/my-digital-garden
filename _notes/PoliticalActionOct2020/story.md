Hey friends and family,

We have one month until the election. 30 days. Daily, I oscillate between anger and despair, but I’m trying really hard to catalyze those feelings into action and dedication. I really hope you’ll read through this email.

This summer I had the chance to go home for two months — longer than I have in a decade. Honestly, an incredible gift to be able to spend that time with my parents, sister & partner. One Sunday in June, Dave and I decided to go on a hike in Big Basin, a state park nestled into the Santa Cruz hills. Big Basin is home to towering redwood trees that are hundreds and thousands of years old. The road to Big Basin winds through the coastal hills, twists and turns transitioning us from the golden California summer into the dense and shaded browns, reds and greens of the redwood forest.

The air was hot, dry and dusty on our six mile loop, our hike dictated by COVID signs that turned trails into one-way paths. Nearing the end of the day, Dave and I sat to take in the woods quietly. Usually, when I arrive in a place like this, where nature is allowed to still run a little wild, I feel immediately at home. It’s often easier for me to feel connected to plants than it is to people. 

But that day, I was really struggling. I couldn’t feel the connection. Every bit of life felt like it had withdrawn into itself. No birds, no moisture, no bugs, not even a squirrel; the woods were not just quiet, they were empty.

Two months later, headlines flashed across Twitter and the New York Times, my parents texting pictures of orange skies and air quality warnings. 

Fires raged through those same hills. Two months after that hike, Big Basin burned down. While many of the ancient trees made it out, the park headquarters and some 70 other buildings, among countless homes, had smoked into rubble and ash

Still now, months later, friends’ homes are threatened by the state’s largest fire in recorded history. A gigafire: one million acres of burning at once. 

Wildfires are symptomatic of human negligence, of both climate change and lack of care when it comes to taking care of our ecosystems. And this year’s hurricane season rages on. And Greenland is melting at rates that are likely unprecedented. I could go on, but it really comes down to this: 

By acknowledging the crisis, and acting on climate change, we have a chance to help save millions of lives, human and otherwise.

So I’m not just asking for a favor, I’m begging for some help: find your lane and act. Don't sit back. Some of you, I know, are already doing so much and have so much on your plate. Thank you. If we can all take on just a little bit more in our day to day lives, we can make a difference.

I'm committing to taking an hour every day to demand that we have a fighting chance for a thriveable, survivable future. With Donald Trump, we lose any chance to act on climate change in the next half a decade or a decade. With Biden and Harris, we might still lose, but we have a chance, we have at least an ear that might just listen.

Come phone bank with me. Write postcards with me. Text bank with me. And if you truly do not have the time, commit to giving daily, or weekly, any amount you can.

I’ve made a website that makes it really easy to find volunteering opportunities. Here’s a calendar you can join that will load all the actions I’m taking, updated regularly. 

One action you can commit to right now: join me in calling youth voters in swing states on Tuesday 10/13 and 10/27, and Monday 10/19. 

Reply to this email if you’re in. I know some of you are already doing a lot! Please let me know what you’re up to, and if you need or want a buddy. 

Much love,
Elizabeth
