title: Orgs & races that need your donations
---

Consider setting up an accountability system where if you miss a day, you have to donate to one of these orgs/races (or one of your choosing). I chose $50 - that's a significant amount of money for me, but not outrageous. An solid incentive, but not one that's going to bankrupt me if I have to miss a couple days. 

Here are just a few ideas for orgs and races, as always, I'm open to suggestions for links to add to this list!
