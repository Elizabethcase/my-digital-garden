Craig Mod [wrote a post](https://craigmod.com/roden/043/) about emotional intelligence and I disagree with most of it? I mostly reject that emotional intelligence is reactionary… and perhaps this isn't what he was going for… but all his examples are retalitory, e.g.

+ "High emotional intelligence is the antipode to bombastic jingoisms, and signals an overcoming of childish impulses. Most importantly: High emotional intelligence does not suffer sloth. Lazy responses are often physical responses, takedowns, attacks, slanders, ad hominems. Someone with high emotional intelligence rises above the low-hanging response, takes time to compose themself, and responds with clarity and with a clear goal in mind. (Which does not strictly preclude emotional intelligence from deploying violence.)"
    
Or 

+ "People with high emotional intelligence don’t look for simple solutions, they look for _durable_ solutions."

I do agree that

+ "Emotional intelligence is often a proxy for grace."

I think emotional intelligence is the ability to generate collective action and collective emotion through a keen understanding of the universal needs and wants of the group while maintaining a direct line to each individual. The latter is not always one way, but sometimes – the "follower" is linked to the highly emotionally intelligent individual, while they are not necessarily linked back except through these collective experiences.

Emotional intelligence also involves the **capacity to give**, e.g. the knowledge about when to give, and deep emotional and mental reserves and strength to do all that giving, to provide the means to fill.

Emotional intelligence is proactive, rather than reactive.
