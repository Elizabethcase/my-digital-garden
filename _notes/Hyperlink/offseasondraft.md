## February 21 
**this ghost story is inspired by a week spent in Provincetown in the middle of winter**

Welcome to Town, nestled on the shores of the coast, tucked between sand dunes and steep cliffs. Here, the beauty of summer is rescued by the bleakness of winter. Follow me, we can tour Restaurant Row -- all closed for the Season of course -- or if you prefer head down to the docks where you could, if it were some other time, rent a boat to haul ancient fish out of the glimmering deeps or explore coral caverns beneath the tumbling sea.

Who am I?

I arrived her once, the same as you. I booked a place to stay in the finest hotel, a room with a bed that could swallow you whole and a view of the ocean through glass so clean I felt I could leap right in.
