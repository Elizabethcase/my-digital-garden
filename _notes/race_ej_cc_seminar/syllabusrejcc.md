title: Race, Environmental Justice, and Climate Change Syllabus
---

This class was created by a group* of Earth and Environmental PhD students at Columbia University/the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Summer 2020. The syllabus was created by all of us, while the linked notes are salient points that I've taken from the lectures, readings, and discussions; they may or may not be edited. An experiment in learning.

\*Kailani Acosta, Lauren Moseley, Roger Creel, Anna Barth, Clara Chang, and me, with input from Mingfang Ting, Maya Tolstoy, Cynthia Thomson, Adam Sobol, and Ben Orlove

## Week 1: Introduction to Environmental Justice

### Speaker: [Dr. Robert Bullard](https://drrobertbullard.com/)

### Readings
+ [Bullard 2001](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3132626?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=environmental&searchText=justice&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Denvironmental%2Bjustice&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-5187%2Ftest&refreqid=search%3A93dad1dcbf028bfa4364013ce48f5323&seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents), Environmental Justice in the 21st Century: Race Still Matters
+ [Purdy (2015)](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/environmentalisms-racist-history), Environmentalism’s Racist History

### Discussion Topics and Questions

**General**

* How do we conceptualize nature, environment, and justice?
* How do class and race influence the environment in which you live and vice versa?
* What does [wilderness mean to you](/race_ej_cc_seminar/wildernessasrestbelonging){: .internal-link}? Discuss the concept of wilderness. For whom is it wild? What does it contrast? Who created the term? How is it used to “other”?
* White privilege and environmental justice
* What does an environmentally just world look like to you? Do you have any examples (from the real world, or stories, or your imagination)?
* What is the history of racism in earth science?
    
**Bullard 2001**

* Bullard lays out this framework (pp 4-5) for environmental justice almost 20 years ago - is there anything that could be added based on our recent knowledge and technological advancements?
    * How does big data, AI, etc. play into this question of environmental justice? Environmental equity? Who has access to data? What information is collected in the first place? What does prevention look like for this issue? 
* Bullard defines equity in 3 main categories (pp 7): procedural, geographic and social. We often talk about achieving equity (in the context of DEI); What does equity mean to you and how can equity be sustained in our communities (locally, nationally, and globally)? 
* Environmental racism is still alive and well. Today, there are substantial environmental justice movements to combat racism - how successful have they been? Why/why not?
    * “A form of illegal ‘extraction’ forces people of color to pay costs of environmental benefits for the public at large. The question of who pays, and who benefits, from the current environmental and industrial policies is central…” 
        * What costs have you paid? What benefits have you reaped?
* Environmental justice is, by definition, grassroots organizing. What role do you play?

**Purdy 2015**

* How is nature (and the definition of nature) “constrained, even produced, by an idea of civilization”? 
* With racism and genocide embedded in the American idea of wilderness, what does environmental justice look like? What does access to the outdoors/the natural world mean? 
* How does our (choice of) language create the “other”? Think about the words “wilderness”, “purity”, “minority”, etc.
* If “the natural world that future generations live in will be the one we create for them”, what does it look like?

## Week 2: Environmental (In)justice in the U.S.

### Speaker - [Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha](https://monahannaattisha.com/)

### Readings
+ [Civil Rights Commission 2017](https://www.michigan.gov/mdcr/0,4613,7-138--405318--a,00.html): Michigan Civil Rights Commission report -- The Flint Water Crisis: Systemic Racism Through the Lens of Flint
+ [Clark 2018](https://bookshop.org/books/the-poisoned-city-flint-s-water-and-the-american-urban-tragedy/9781250181619): The Poisoned City -- Flint’s water and the American Urban Tragedy <a name="wk2ch3notes">[Chapter 3](/race_ej_cc_seminar/readingnotes/Wk2_PoisonedCityCh3){: .internal-link}</a> and Chapter 8)

### Discussion Topics and Questions

**General**
* What has been your relationship with the water you drink?

**Civil Rights Commission Report**

* How do we define a “public good” like water? Who gets to decide what sorts of systems should be regulated by local and state governments, and what that regulation should look like?
* The report argues “that race played a role in the Flint Water Crisis precisely because it was never considered.  That it is so deeply entrenched in the very fiber of society that we have normalized what occurs in communities that are ‘primarily of color’ and poor.”
    * What needs to change in order for this pattern of default racism to be disrupted?
    * How does implicit bias intersect with public policy?
    * What is the difference between individual and systemic racism?
* How have racialized public policies on local, regional, or national levels affected you?
* What does a just government, one whose decisions would not have led to the Flint crisis, look like to you?  
* How should we assign individual responsibility when a public system fails?  
  
**The Poisoned City**

* How do we balance the need for data-driven inquiry and policy-making with the lived realities of people experiencing environmental degradation?
    * How can policy be created with [Colloquial Data](/race_ej_cc_seminar/colloquialdata){: .internal-link} embedded? 
* Dr. Hanna-Attisha didn’t have to break any laws to whistleblow, but other whistleblowers have had to do so.  At what point is breaking the law for a just cause warranted?
    * What if it involved invasion of patient privacy/violation of HIPAA?
* What protections should a scientific whistleblower like Dr. Hanna-Attisha receive?
