Flint, Michigan known for GM & creation of UAW --> was the richest per capita city in the country (1970s), now is one of the poorest

GM once employed 90k people, now 90k don't even live in Flint;

Prosperity declined as GM left

In 2000s, emergency managers rammed through to run  – job was to save money (Flint bankrupt)

Half of African-American population was under emergency management; only 2% of white population

Kirk.. ? was primarily funded by ACLU to investigate impacts of state management (e.g. freedoms taken away) on primarily minority population 

Michigan surrounded by 21% of the world's freshwater 

– call dropped – 

The people of Flint were loud and brave and organized

Within a few months, GM noticed that their engine parts were corroding because of the drinking water. GM plant was allowed to go back to Great Lakes water, Flint residents were gaslit --> told to relax, everything was fine, etc

Continuing to be a pediatrician… my patients kept coming in and saying should i really keep drinking this water, should i be mixing formula..

the thought that was going through my head was – "how could our tapwater not be ok?"

lead is bad – recommends Lead Wars by Rosner – Lead is a "multi-headed hydra" – wherever you turn, there's another study that shows the bad things lead does
- developmental, attention, hearing, lifelong multigenerational consequences, reproductive, maternal fetal problems, cardiovascular disease, early dementia, seizures, coma

we have gotten to a place in the scientific and medical community where were know that there are "no safe levels of lead"
- 1920s - GM called lead "a gift from god" when putting lead in gasoline, defying science that knew EVEN THEN that lead was poison

should have ended when the first mom held a jug of brown water

but it definitely should have ended when we found lead in teh water

i had to supply proof of harm

went to a press conference – got disobedience award for not going through peer review

flint back on great lakes water

we had this population wide lead exposure, also an outbreak of legionarres disease, skin issues --> **a population level trauma**

so much of this story is science denial
science spoke truth to power

how to mitigate impact?
- medicaid expansion
- behavior health services
- new childcare centers
- nutritional support
- mental health hotlines

all kid need these things!

also working on the bigger things that make communities whole
- role of restorative justice 
- participatory democracy

so many kids in this country wake up to nightmares
- stolen democracy
- loss of opportunity

one of the biggest lessons of this story: we don't have to accept the status quo

the story of flint is the story of a crime, committed with absolute indifference against some of the most vulnerable people in our country.. but it's also a story for how normal people came together and refused to accept what was happening, refused to accept the injustice, and fought for our kids, and one

a playbook of resistance and hope

and that is a story we all need right now

nutrition prescription program – pediatric clinic above a farmers market, subsidized by rite aid, lead to national program ($25 mil)

"Ground yourself in your why.  Why do you wake up?  Why do you do your work?  Why are you here in this lecture?  These children are my why.  My why is their dreams.  Why you can ground yourself in your why, that helps you focus your message.  It enables me to get into rooms; it opens doors.  I am seen as pediatrician whose mission is children."

the flint case was a case of environmental justice – the people impacted weren't included or listened to
how are folks given a seat at the stable?
so always – involve pre-policy rather than post-policy
more representation, more diversity
child impact statements
academia as the checks and balances to government?
