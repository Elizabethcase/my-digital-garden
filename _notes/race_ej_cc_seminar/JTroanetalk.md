June Jordan's introduction to Okay Now

Jordan wanted the novel to serve a pedalogical function – see that "we are not helpless here (in Mississippi America)" – we can save Brownfield, urban and rural black life, as surely as we can transform the lockheed 

the only way to transform into a democracy as the united states… were the redistribution of land and the remaking of terrestrial environments

june jordan as a primary progenitor of black ecological thought
- ranging from folk and blues traditions (which have their own important relationships with the environment and environmental degradation) to more formal analysis

black ecological thought: refuses to displace objects of concern outside of… 

remaking science fiction language for social justice

terraforrming – taking account the unlivability of the american landscape

letters to her partner about the 1965 harlem riot
- how does june jordan view Black people as the future 
- "the mushrooms of police that emerge"

most important: Black lives, urban space, rural land, and ecology are intimately intertwined

she is seeking to provide to families… realistic example of human pleasure and health – changes that don't cost money
- unsanitized – drug use, violence show up in children's work
- she's not trying to create a world where green and idyllic misplaces urban life, but rather where worlds where it can be fully articulated

by 1996 - june Jordan is thinking about the end of oil !
jordan's desire for return to the south escapes the kind of idyllic imaginary of rural idyllicism vs urban catastrophe

post great migration move back to the south

okay now – a land reform proposal; anti-land property, share the earth philosophy

black environmental thought emphasizes question of infrastructure, political economy, housing
