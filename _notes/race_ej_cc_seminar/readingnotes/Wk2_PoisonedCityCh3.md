title: The Poisoned City Chapter 3 Notes

For you are not powerless.… We do not need to become each other in order to
work together. But we do need to recognize each other, our differences as well
as the sameness of our goals. Not for altruism. For self-preservation—survival.
—Audre Lorde, “[Commencement Address: Oberlin College](https://queerhistory.com/radical-graduation)” (1989)

"The disparities in the water traced a pattern of inequality and disinvestment that was decades in the making."

Contaminated water affected Flint's (majority) Black population more than any of the suburbs (why?)

Most folks came to Flint to work in the auto industry (Ford, GM)

(What is it that is so compelling about lists? - iron, lead, steel, rubber, oil, plate glass, upholstery leather, tin, cotton, mohair, copper, glue, cork, turpentine, silicon, cadmium)

Auto-industry left in second-half of 20th century (presumably for offshore factories) – note that even now, GM is the largest employer in Flint.. but likely all that means, is that no one else has moved in

Housing market discrimination – inability to gain generational wealth
> GM eventually constructed nearly three thousand homes in the neighborhoods of Civic Park, Chevrolet Park, and Mott Park. They were not sold on the public market, and they were offered to workers on friendly terms: 10 percent down payment, 6 percent interest, and mortgage payments that were about 1 percent of the total cost. But even if they could afford them, black people—who could work only in lower-tier jobs at GM, such as janitors or laborers in the dangerous foundries—were not allowed to buy them.
    
+ increased exposure to pollutants
+ exacerbated by federal policy – federally-backed mortgages only available in "neighborhoods that were deemed safe bets for lending"
+ also from Bullard's talk – who owns properties.. means who gets to be bought out by the federal gov't when it comes to climate migration/mitigation
+ ability to improve = crucial --> poor whites were also redlined, but _they could change their circumstances_
+ Jews (and Italians) were subject to some of this discrimination as well 
        + how did Jews develop generational wealth?
+ **CORPORATE responsibility** --> GM's practices made Flint the most segregated city in the north. Where is the accountability?
+ Black communities have to pay up, when they have nowhere else to go
