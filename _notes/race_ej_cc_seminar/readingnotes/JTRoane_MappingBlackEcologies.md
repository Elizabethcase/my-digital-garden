In "Mapping Black Ecologies", [JT Roane](https://twitter.com/jtroane) and [Justin Hosbey](http://anthropology.emory.edu/home/people/faculty/hosbey.html) define and refine the term **Black Ecologies**, which refer to the knowledge and lived experience of Black communities most directly affected by, and placed in the path of, climate change & ecological crisis.

Quick vocab:
epistemic - relating to knowledge/degree of validation  
liminal space - threshhold, inbetween, not one or the other

_Black ecologies_

> Black ecologies are spaces threatened directly by the rising seas
and made toxic as the sites where the byproducts of production
and consumption can be dumped

> At the same time, they form the critical ecologies of the damned,
sites wherein ordinary Black people articulate alternative maps—
dissonant and heterodox ecological grammars as well as vision for
a different order.

> “Black memory is often at odds with state memory.” - Michael Hanchard

Catastrophe as not just exacerbation, but as an act of revelation:

> Events of environmental catastrophe lay bare the core dimensions
of the social sphere in which they occur.  
- when land is cut through, lain bare, sent into a state of emergency, international gaze peels back white gauze to reveal festering wound of inequity
- storms do not create inequality, the reveal it

As geographers [Katherine McKittrick and Clyde Woods explain](https://www.worldcat.org/title/black-geographies-and-thepolitics-of-place/oclc/608374920), these storms 
> “brought into clear focus, at least momentarily, a legacy of uneven geographies, of those locations long occupied by les damnés de la terre/the wretched of the earth: **the geographies of the homeless, the jobless, the incarcerated, the invisible laborers, the underdeveloped, the criminalized, the refugee, the kicked about, the impoverished, the abandoned, the unescaped**”

People who post & tag (geolocate) on twitter = _real time cartographers_

Anthropocene indites all humans – but it's not all humans, it's a subset of (largely white, wealthy) humans who have caused the most global warming.. so more appropriate to call it a **racial capitalocene**? See   
[Françoise Vergès critique](https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/3376-racial-capitalocene) on the term "Anthropocene"

Western cartography for western imperialism/colonialism → e.g. [see map](https://twitter.com/EmmaSlager/status/1308189987087638529) of "US population" that completely erases Indigenous presence (US census did not count Indigenous people)

2D map flatten 3D spaces; "birds-eye view = inherently colonial". Let's think about different dimnsionalities.. Not just height of the land, but it's depth and breadth: 
- another dimension = people's narratives and voices 

What is and isn't mapped by gov'ts, universities? Who is at the table when those maps are made? What does a true representation of the world look like, and to whom? See Borges short story [Exactitude in Science](http://www.openculture.com/on-exactitude-in-science-by-jorge-luis-borges).

Every simplification is an exclusion

Argues that environmental history injustices began with colonization of the Americas & I might argue that it began even earlier, with, e.g. crusades, imperialism, etc. (though maybe we are just talking about within the US)

Plantation owners forcing slaves to remake the land in their image – participate in their own future vulnerability and present oppression against, e.g. Indigenous people, the land
