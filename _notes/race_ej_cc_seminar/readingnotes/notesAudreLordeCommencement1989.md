Notes/excerpts from this address, which can be found here: [https://queerhistory.com/radical-graduation](https://queerhistory.com/radical-graduation)

- this could be given today

> A war for survival in the twenty-first century, the survival of this planet and all this planet's people.

- the survival of the planet!

> what did she say, tell them I asked you the most fundamental question of your life—who are you, and how are you using the powers of that self in the service of what you believe?

- what are your (my) powers? what are you in service of? what is your identity?

> You are inheriting a country that has grown hysterical with denial and contradiction… We are citizens of the most powerful country on earth—we are also citizens of a country that stands upon the wrong side of every liberation struggle on earth. Feel what that means. It is a reality that haunts each of our lives and that can help inform our dreams. It's not about altruism, it's about self-preservation. Survival.

- (whatever we're feeling now, others have lived it before, and harder)
- how does it haunt? how do I move dreams beyond response and into imagination, pre-emption?

> Your beauty and your promise lie like a haze over your faces. I beg you, do not waste it. Translate that power and beauty into action wherever you find yourself to be, or you will participate in your own destruction.

- (our, is your without the why)

>  To face the realities of our lives is not a reason for despair—despair is a tool of your enemies. Facing the realities of our lives gives us motivation for action. For you are not powerless.

- despair is a tool, don't take it too personally
