title: Colloquial Data

Reading "[The Poisoned City](https://bookshop.org/books/the-poisoned-city-flint-s-water-and-the-american-urban-tragedy/9781250125149)"
Idea emerged from [Race, Environmental Justice, and Climate Change](/race_ej_cc_seminar/syllabusrejcc){: .internal-link} seminar

People speak in terms of taste & smell – they describe their environment with their senses, not with numbers. When Flint residents first started noticing changes to their water, they described the water as ["discolored, smelly, and undrinkable"](https://www.vox.com/2016/2/15/10991626/flint-water-crisis). How can we integrate colloquial data (layman language) into policy, which speaks in terms of ppms and percentages? What would a law look like, that was written to rapidly redress wrongdoing in a way that allowed for language and stories to trigger action?

I know there are folks working on this – for example, the [Atlas of Caregiving](https://www.vox.com/2016/2/15/10991626/flint-water-crisis) captures individual stories and experiences by visualizing networks and relationships through physical drawings and symbols. The question is – how do we take individual stories and experiences and make sure policy can hear those stories? Adjacently, one issue may be experienced by thousands, millions, billions of people… how do we build policy that listens to and responds to needs at each of these scales: the individual, and the billions?
