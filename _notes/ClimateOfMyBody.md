All my emotions are weather (thinking about them as floods, storms, tidal waves, droughts)

What is the climate of my body? What is it's average state, it's patterns, it's tendencies? Is the average state meaningful?

At my worst, I am a flat, grey November sky.

At my best, when I am really on, I am a deliciously cold October day, biting and bright but not with malice â€“ with life. I know, this is still weather. I do think I have seasons, and more than two? Six? Eight? What are my seasons? What are my cycles?
