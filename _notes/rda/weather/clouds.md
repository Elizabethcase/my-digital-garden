>“The night I stayed too late I was hunched on the fog staring spellbound at spreading, reflecting stains of lilac on the water. A cloud in the sky suddenly lighted as if turned on by a switch; its reflection just as suddenly materialized on the water upstream…“ - Annie Dillard, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek (1974)

In general, clouds are classified by their altitude and form, which relates to the cloud’s stability. Depending on its type, a cloud might insulate (warm) the surface beneath it, or cool it, by reflecting incoming sunlight.

Low-lying cumulus clouds puff along gently, indicating fair [weather](/rda/weather/cccf-weather){: .internal-link}. They tend to have flat bottoms and rounded, lumpy tops. Wispy cirrus clouds show up high in the atmosphere, and an abundance of them may indicate the arrival of a warm front (and weather). Cumulonimbus clouds form near the ground and tower upwards. Also known as thunderheads, these clouds announce the arrival of serious weather -- storms, tornados, hail, snow, and hurricanes. 

Clouds form when the air reaches its saturation point. Warmer air can hold more water vapor; colder air less. At the saturation point, water vapor condense onto dust, pollen, or other condensation nuclei. Clouds can form as land-warmed air rises, over land masses (mountains), as pressure fronts collide, as cold air masses displace warmer ones, or at low pressure points. Eventually, when enough water condenses around a nuclei, the force of gravity pulls the ice or water back down to the planet, creating precipitation in the form of rain, hail, sleet, or snow.
