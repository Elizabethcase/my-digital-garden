I'm particularly grateful to have had Any and Ramon as classmates. Anya's thoughtful relation to her teaching, our camaraderie over teaching science, and her absolute mastery of weaving references, experience, and class topics, greatly contributed to my understanding of the material (and the world!). Ramon's enthusiasm for taking on the most immense project (reparative worldmaking!) and his consistent and thoughtful critique of readings throughout the last 15 weeks was both inspiring and forced me to more deeply consider my role in things. Amanda and Sebastian both contributed asynchronously, through suggestions of readings, films, and other pieces of media that related to my final project.

Being remote most of the time, I struggled a bit to participate in class when I was on zoom, but I hope I have made contributions to the course by through sharing links, events, projects, and suggestions on the class slack. In class, I tried to make my participation as hands-on as possible, e.g. by bringing in clay for my object analysis by modeling and drawing out our group's course ideas at Little Island. I aimed to bring in a perspective from the sciences, but also joined the class as a way to open myself to other (better!!!!! and/or different) ways of doing, learning, teaching, and collaborating.
