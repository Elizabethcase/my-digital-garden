title: "Weather"
---

Weather is the daily manifestation of complex relationships between land, atmosphere, and the hydrologic cycle. Varying air mass temperatures, densities, and humidity levels, along with solar radiation, ocean circulation patterns and large-scale atmospheric transport, affect day-to-day weather. [Clouds](/rda/weather/clouds){: internal-link} are one byproduct and component of weather. Climate, on the other hand, is a long-term average of these trends. The day-to-day weather is affected by, but does not define, climate.

Weather is a perfect tool for learning [how to observe](/rda/observation){: .internal-link}. Pair with [Cloud Architecture](/rda/fictions/arch-cloud writing){: .internal-link} Try keeping a [weather journal](/rda/activities/weather journal.pdf) for an entire week. Seven days of weather journals will count as one of your three projects.
