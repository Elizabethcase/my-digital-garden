Milankovitch Cycles are natural variations in the earth's orbit and tilt which play major a role in longterm [climate](/rda/climate/cccf-limate){: .internal-link}, determining the periodicity of glacial and interglacial periods during Earth's [ice ages](/rda/paleoclimate/cccf-ice-ages){: .internal-link}. 

There are three main components.

1. Eccentricity
2. Tilt
3. Obliquity
