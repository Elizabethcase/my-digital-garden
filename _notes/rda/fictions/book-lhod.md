The Left Hand of Darkness takes place on the planet Gethen/Winter, following Genly Ai, an ethnographer from the planet Terra, as he struggles to comprehend and integrate into Gethenian politics and society.

Much can be said of Le Guin's exploration of gender and how it impacts society. Or of how the Gethenians relate to time ("It is always Year One here"). For this course, we will use this text to learn about [ice ages](/rda/paleoclimate/cccf-ice-ages){: .internal-link} ("I was dressed for the Ice Age and not for the sunshine," p. 6), and think a little bit about [weather](/rda/weather/cccf-weather){: .internal-link} (rain shows up on p. 2, snow, p. 10) and [climate](/rda/climate/cccf-climate){: .internal-link}.

Assignment: Read chapters 16-18. The ice becomes a character. Identify 2-3 descriptions that are also character traits. For each, write one paragraph about their physical bases -- e.g. crevassing near the front of the ice sheet -- and one about how they build the ice into its own entity.
