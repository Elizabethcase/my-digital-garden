In *Cloud Writing: Describing Soft Architectures of Change in the Anthropocene*, [Ada Smailbegović](https://vivo.brown.edu/display/asmailbe) grapples with the temporality of weather, on one hand, and the climate change, on the other. The changing cloud architecture of the [*Blur Building*](https://dsrny.com/project/blur-building) defies easy description, as it changes continuously and languidly. The rates of change caused by anthropogenic climate change are idiosyncratic with humanity’s ability to observe. For one, the changes may be hidden away, say, in a seed responding to warmer temperatures. For others, there may be a threshold at which dramatic change occurs, obscuring change until it happens all at once. For still more, change happens on a scale too slow or too large for us to really see. Smailbegović argues that the act of description can be a sort of time-augmenting methodology, “….description can act as a technology of amplification, flooding the delineated frame of the present with luminous grain of detail, in turn rendering perceptible a more variegated sense of the kinds of change that dynamically constitute the presence… In other words, through this amplification in “detail of sensing,“ differentiated rhythms of change become evident…“.

**Assignment**
- Read through the essay and a few journal excerpts of [Dorothy Wordsworth’s](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/42856/42856-h/42856-h.htm), below (or feel free to peruse others in this link). 
- Look up the weather for upcoming week on [darksky.net](https://darksky.net/forecast/40.7127,-74.0059/us12/en), and screenshot those predictions. 
- For the next seven days, fill out one [Weather Journal][weather journal](/rda/activities/weather journal.pdf){: .internal-link} every day. You will have seven journals by the end of the week. Please turn at least one of them in by scanning/photographing, or as a hard copy.
- At the end of those seven days, write 500 words reflecting on a) the process of observing the weather, and whether it changed over the course of the week, b) any coherence or dissonance between the weather predictions and your observations, and c) the weather you experienced and its relationships to the clouds you observed. Include the names of the clouds you observed, and the weather often associated with these clouds.

_24th._—Went to the hill-top. Sat a considerable time overlooking the country towards the sea. The air blew pleasantly round us. The landscape mildly interesting. The Welsh hills capped by a huge range of tumultuous white clouds. The sea, spotted with white, of a bluish grey in general, and streaked with darker lines. The near shores clear; scattered farm houses, half-concealed by green mossy orchards, fresh straw lying at the doors; hay-stacks in the fields. Brown fallows, the springing wheat, like a shade of green over the brown earth, and the choice meadow plots, full of sheep and lambs, of a soft and vivid green; a few[Pg 11] wreaths of blue smoke, spreading along the ground; the oaks and beeches in the hedges retaining their yellow leaves; the distant prospect on the land side, islanded with sunshine; the sea, like a basin full to the margin; the dark fresh-ploughed fields; the turnips of a lively rough green. Returned through the wood.

_21st._—We drank tea at Coleridge's. A quiet shower of snow was in the air during more than half our walk. At our return the sky partially shaded with clouds. The horned moon was set. Startled two night birds from the great elm tree.

_Thursday._—A very hot morning. W. and I walked up to Mr. Simpson's. W. and old Mr. S. went to fish in Wytheburn water. I dined with John and lay under the trees. The afternoon changed from clear to cloudy, and to clear again. John and I walked up to the waterfall, and to Mr. Simpson's, and with Miss Simpson. Met the fishers. W. caught a pike weighing 4¾ lbs. There was a gloom almost terrible over Grasmere water and vale. A few drops fell but not much rain. No Coleridge, whom we fully expected.

_Sunday Morning, 3rd._— ... A heavenly warm evening, with scattered clouds upon the hills. There was a vernal greenness upon the grass, from the rains of the morning and afternoon. Peas for dinner.

_Wednesday._—William went up into the orchard and finished the poem. I went and sate with W. and walked backwards and forwards in the orchard till dinner time. He read me his poem. I read to him, and my Beloved slept. A sweet evening as it had been a sweet day, and I walked quietly along the side of Rydale lake with quiet thoughts—the hills and the lake were still—the owls had not begun to hoot, and the little birds had given over singing. I looked before me and saw a red light upon Silver How as if coming out of the vale below,

There was a light of most strange birth, A light that came out of the earth, And spread along the dark hill-side.

Thus I was going on when I saw the shape of my Beloved in the road at a little distance. We turned back to see the light but it was fading—almost gone. The owls hooted when we sate on the wall at the foot of White Moss; the sky broke more and more, and we saw the moon now and then. John Gill passed us with his cart; we sate on. When we came in sight of our own dear Grasmere, the vale looked fair and quiet in the moonshine, the Church was there and all the cottages. There were huge slow-travelling clouds in the sky, that threw large masses of shade upon some of the mountains. We walked backwards and forwards, between home and Olliff's, till I was tired. William kindled, and began to write the poem. We carried cloaks into the orchard, and sate a while there. I left him, and he nearly finished the poem. I was tired to death, and went to bed before[Pg 102] him. He came down to me, and read the poem to me in bed. A sailor begged here to-day, going to Glasgow. He spoke cheerfully in a sweet tone.
