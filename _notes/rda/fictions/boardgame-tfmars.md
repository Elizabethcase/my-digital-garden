In Terraforming Mars, players compete as corporations to contribute the most to the habitability of the red planet over the course of generations. Technologies, ecologies, rare minerals, and other resources are used to plant forests, create oceans, and raise the atmospheric oxygen concentration to 14% and the temperature to +8 °C. 

This simplistic and capitalistic view of terraforming a planet can nevertheless be a useful tool for learning about what makes a planet habitable. Plants (algae, trees, ecosystems) photosynthesize sunlight into energy, carbon dioxide into oxygen. Oceans serve as homes to vast quantities of life, in addition to acting as heat reservoirs.

**Assignment**
1. Play a game of Terraforming Mars.
2. Reflect, briefly (<200 words), what strategies were most effective in creating oceans and forests, or raising oxygen levels or temperature. 
3. Identify two project cards from the game. Depending on the card, discuss its ecological, geological, or physical basis and/or importance. Are its benefits and/or drawbacks realistic? Does the technology exist now? 
4. What’s missing from this game? Choose a geologic, oceanic, climatic, or ecological phenomenon necessary for life on earth. Create a project card or mechanism that would add it to the game.
