title: Gravity

Gravity is the universal force of attraction between all bodies of matter. The weakest of the natural forces, physicists *still do not* understand its origin. 

The gravitational constant, *G*, equals [6.674×10−11 m3⋅kg−1⋅s−2.](https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?bg)

The pull of gravity between any two objects is proportional to the masses of those objects and the distance between them. This can be written mathematically as, 

$F = G* \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$

Why do we care about gravity?

For one, it hugs our [atmosphere](/rda/cccf-greenhouse){: .internal-link} close to the planet. It keeps us in orbit around our sun. It keeps our feet on the ground (but says nothing about where our minds might go).
