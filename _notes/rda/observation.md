title: Observation, or, learning how to see the world
---

A key component of the scientific process, of learning about your bioregion, and of making space in your life to see how what we learn here shows up in your day-to-day life, is the practice of **observation**.

Observation is a tool and a practice. You can practice by keeping a [weather journal](/rda/activities/weather journal.pdf), one way of being present in the world with a long history in science and in living.

For examples of observation and its role in the scientific process, we're going to read excerpts from Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, Ed Shackleton's diaries, Robin Wall Kimmerer's Braiding Sweetgrass, and Ada SmailbegoviÄ‡ essay on Cloud Writing. Each of these texts relates in turn to other concepts we're learning in this class.
