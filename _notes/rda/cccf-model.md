If I had all the time & coding ability in the world, here’s a concept for the cover page of this website: 
	Continuously scrolling bar on the write with the course title “Climate Science Climate Fiction.” Geocities-bright background, but of satellite images of the earth. Within an iframe/window, a view into a garden, with arrows pointing variously to where one might click. A toolbar in the upper right hand corner pulls up two maps - a conceptual map that looks like one you would get at a botanical garden, and a map of concepts that shows all the linking files. Links along the bottom of the page lead to the Github, About This Course, and Inclusion Statment.
