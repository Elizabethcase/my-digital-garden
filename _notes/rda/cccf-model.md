# Concept & Appearance

<img src="https://elizabethcase.net/rda/assets/model.png" width="700">
A virtual garden tour, linking pictures of gardens, forests, minecraft creations, and virtual spaces, connects subjects cyclically and thematically. Many climate science topics (green) are paired with a fiction (yellow) and a project, intended to apply, deepen, or reframe the scientific concepts.

If I had all the time & coding ability in the world, here’s a concept for the cover page of this website: 
	Continuously scrolling bar on the write with the course title “Climate Science Climate Fiction.” Geocities-bright background, but of satellite images of the earth. Within an iframe/window, a view into a garden, with arrows pointing variously to where one might click. A toolbar in the upper right hand corner pulls up two maps - a conceptual map that looks like one you would get at a botanical garden, and a map of concepts that shows all the linking files. Links along the bottom of the page lead to the Github, About This Course, and Inclusion Statement.

# Simultaneous connections 

## Connection 1
I’ve been interested in using zines as a) modes of communicating climate science/experience and b) tools for learning how to communicate science. This semester, I won a small grant that allowed me the opportunity to work with Nathan Lenssen and his students in a course on “Climate Change Impacts on Humans in NYC.” With the help of scientist, designer, and friend Suki Wong, we led four workshops. Each student condensed the information from their term research papers into zines that will be printed at Secret Riso Club. Thirteen new climate zines, coming your way!

## Connection 2
My work on this project led directly to a collaboration with Amelia Greenhall from Anenome. She will print the first versions of a “[Climate Emergency Reading Recs](https://shop.anemone.studio/product/climate-emergency-reading-recs)” zine today (Friday, May 13)! We catalogued more than 120 books! I’ve included the cover and some of the excerpts I wrote for it below.
