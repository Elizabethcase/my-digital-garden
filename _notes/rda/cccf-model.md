# Concept & Appearance

<img src="https://elizabethcase.net/rda/assets/model.png" width="700">
A virtual garden tour, linking pictures of gardens, forests, minecraft creations, and virtual spaces, connects subjects cyclically and thematically. Many climate science topics (green) are paired with a fiction (yellow) and a project, intended to apply, deepen, or reframe the scientific concepts.

If I had all the time & coding ability in the world, here’s a concept for the cover page of this website: 
	Continuously scrolling bar on the write with the course title “Climate Science Climate Fiction.” Geocities-bright background, but of satellite images of the earth. Within an iframe/window, a view into a garden, with arrows pointing variously to where one might click. A toolbar in the upper right hand corner pulls up two maps - a conceptual map that looks like one you would get at a botanical garden, and a map of concepts that shows all the linking files. Links along the bottom of the page lead to the Github, About This Course, and Inclusion Statement.

# Simultaneous connections 

My work on this project led directly to a collaboration with Amelia Greenhall from Anenome. She will print the first versions of a “Climate Emergency Reading Recs” zine today (Friday, May 13). We catalogued more than 120 books! I’ve included the cover and some of the excerpts I wrote for it below.
