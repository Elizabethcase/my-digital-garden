#cycling #walking #time

Cycling accelerates distance into time; walking transforms time into space.

This was inspired by the newsletter Ridgeline, by Craig Mod (is that his last name?). He posed the question "what shell are you ripped from" in regards to walking.

At first I tried to place in the context of cycling versus walking. 

Iâ€™ve identified as a cyclist mostly. When the land transitions seasons, say summer to fall, cycling for a few days north accelerates space into time and each pedal stroke brings the season closer.  Along the roads of upstate new york, breathe in the sweet-heavy sent of overripe apples, head down to lean into a whipping, cold breeze from the north, turn the bend to see a whole valley laid out in the amber tones of fall.

Walking, it seems, does the opposite: it turns time into space. Space as in, space to observe, space to watch grown, space to feel the whole of a season coming into the land at once, from underneath, as wildflowers push their way through cold earth, from the south, as mallards return to the creek to mate. The creek swells with the rain and falls as it dries. Spatial, spatial. Time turns into space.
