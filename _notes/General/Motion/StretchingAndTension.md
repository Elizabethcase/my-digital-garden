Lie down on your back, arms by your sides, or out a little, palms facing up, legs outstretched. 

What is relaxed? What is tense? 

Now, tuck your knees into your chest. Your left hand loops around your right wrist. Your left hand has to hold tension – but in exchange, your hip flexors relax. Sometimes, the release is painful. Their relaxation is not possible without tension.

Sit back up. Match the sole of your right foot to your left. Let your knees hang out. Drop your head and arms.

Your hips may be stretching, but they are not in tension (they are also not relaxed). Stretching **is not** tension.
