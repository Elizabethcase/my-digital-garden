La Última Niebla/The Final Mist/The House of Mist

María Luisa Bombal is an almost-forgotten matriarch of Latin American magical realism. She was born in Chile in 1910, lived with Neruda and his wife while she wrote and published her first book, and edited & published Borgés', among many others. She moved to the US in 1940 and lived there for 30 years, returning to Chile 10 years before her death in 1980.

Bombal translated much of her own work herself – and as a result, her work as published in Spanish is different (read: revised and edited) than her writing in English. I've been reading her work in English since my Spanish isn't quite up to par anymore, and actually the translation I read of La Ultima Niebla entitled "The Final Mist" was by Richard Cunningham.
