title: An overview of Digital Gardens
---

Digital gardens are a overarching term for sites that take advantage of digital spaces to link thoughts and generate ideas. In most gardens, notes are well-pruned (i.e. thought through, edited, synthesized) and growing with others (always linked to other notes). 

Some key (technical) features of digital gardens:

+ **Forward linking** are common hyperlinks you might see on any site, and they can refer out to other webpages, or to internal documents.
+ **Backward linking**, which you can see on the right, show the internal notes that link back to this page. This allows for exploration between ideas that may not be immediately apparent.
+ **Mind maps** scroll down, and you can see a map of all the notes and how they link to each other. Some areas are their own islands; some have many links, some very view. Helpful for visualizing connections and adjacency.

Other features I like to include that lean into the digital garden metaphor

+ **Weeds** are a variety of links & quotes that may not have a fully-formed thought to go along with them, may dead-end, but nevertheless contribute to the exploratory aspect of this garden
+ **Seed storage** are lists of links, like this [list of recommendations](/linklist){: .internal-link}, or my [daily-ish link log](/lookedattoday){: .internal-link}

Finally, I'm interested in applying the ideas of backwards and forwards hyperlinking, [adjacent references](https://thecorrespondent.com/550/the-future-earth/690928670300-95b6d8db), [stacking panes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), and [embedded play](https://distill.pub/2020/communicating-with-interactive-articles/#making-systems-playful) to publish & communicate science (note coming soon), and improve my ability [to learn from a class](/race_ej_cc_seminar/syllabusrejcc){: .internal-link}.
