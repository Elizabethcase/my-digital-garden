On Alexandra Kleeman's "Intimation"

Cake = clock → sets a timer (creates momentum), also creates something that could go wrong (creates tension)
- Similar to giving characters a task to complete, it creates a movement of time (versus a movement of body, a physical movement)

Lots of subverting tropes
- introduction –> first paragraph describes a world with routines (doors are openings), second sentence breaks that routine
- asking a question looking for an answer from a magically appearing man → fairytale trope (also baby appearing out of nowhere, emotions changing unwillingly, etc)
    - also, she never asks him how, or if, she can leave.. that is the obvious question, no?

Really like the first person almost flipping to third – unsure of emotions, emotions being observed
> "This feeling of lessening disturbance, coming from within myself, unexpected, was profoundly disturbing .As I sat still growing less and less alarmed by the situation, I knew that I had to move fast, move as fast and as far as I could within this small, cramped house"

> "I looked angry"

> "I missed you too, I said / That sentence came as a real shock."

(We never even talked about the title!)

Metaphor for societal expectations, man = the man, complacency, having to go along with things, feeling trapped in a life, etc
- I like it less if it is this

Where did she start this story from? Marriage? A room with no door? Doors?  

Use the past to tell about the present
- mouse flashback
    - glass = view into world, no entrance or exit

Favorite passage

> "What I really wanted was to opt out of the causal relation between myself and this cake, the causal relation that I couldn't seem to avoid, living in this house that I now appeared to live in. The proximity was changing me: I couldn't avoid seeing or noticing thins that happened in this place, and because I was the only other person around, things couldn't help but involved themselves in me. I decided to think about the orbital motions of the moon around the earth, and of what might happen if the force of one on the other ever exceeded expectations, pulling the two uncomfortably close, causing them to crash together in a fiery and highly destructive event. But he was taking up so much space in me now, I could no longer think around him, peer around him, to the shapes of things I had known before I entered this place. What had he meant by a surprise, and what had he meant by something to celebrate? How much time had elapsed in his experience, and was it really different from how much time had elapsed in mine? Or was I instead just a highly avoidant person with serious difficulties connecting to others? I didn't want to be so difficult, but that difficulty felt like a part of me, a part that I didn't want taken over by new features belonging to a me that did not yet exist."
