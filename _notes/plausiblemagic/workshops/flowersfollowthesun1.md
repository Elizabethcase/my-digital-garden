Hi Georgia,

Thanks so much for sharing your work. What a searing telling of grief, especially from the point of view of Elodie, whose gift as a child is that she has the freedom to accept what is happening around her while maintaining a keenness of observation beyond her years.

I loved the moment Coraline crawls into bed with Elodie, absolutely broke my heart. The ending of this draft felt really organic – using Agatha as an example to guide readers into what the story will focus on, Elodie is propelled into her journey to find the stories of these ghosts and finally allow them to rest. Already the tragedy and joy of the coming pages feels tangible! It reads nicely as a coming of age story, and a coming-to-terms-with-loss story. Imogen's passing is going to be particularly difficult.

I think the ghost intimation works in this story, though it might depend on the genre you're aiming for. For example, for YA, it strikes me as a really useful, powerful tool because it gives you a lot of flexibility in how they interact with the world, and their very existence gives Elodie a task.

I found it a bit difficult to follow the timeline of the story – when we were in the past versus present, which house we were in, etc. I think ironing out the timeline for the readers would really make the strangeness of grief, Elodie's calm acceptance, and Imogen's existance stand out. For example, when does the beginning of the story take place? And when Elodie's mother comes into the room, what triggers this memory if they are already in a new house? Give us some hints about which memories belong to which rooms, which rooms belong to which house, and which house belongs to which town using visual and sensory details. It might help also to have some cues about Elodie's age from time to time, since I think? she transitions from youngish (9) to early teens in the story but I'm not sure, and her voice seems to shift from childish to older when she talks to Agatha.

I'd love to read some more physical and sensory details about the world – you begin so strongly with the clementine, its sourness, it's physicality; I'd love to see this continued through the story. The richness of the world belying the ghost-like people that exist in it. Elodie's keen observation – she can see what others can't – coming through in how you detail locations, smells, and emotions. There's some danger in overwriting, but I think it would help readers gain more of a sense of place within the story.

I wonder if it might be effective to make the presence of her father in the house so intangible, that it almost becomes as if he is a ghost? A bit of a role reversal between him and Imogen. Might be too heavy handed, just an idea.

I made some small edits here and there about where you might be able to tighten your language, these are just suggestions, hope they are at all helpful!

Looking forward to reading more.

Cheers,
Elizabeth
