I struggle with academic writing – that is, as a scientist in geophysics, writing about my scientific processes. I don't ever flow; this usually stems from not knowing what to write. Academic writing feels far off, physically distant. While I often experience writer's block when I work creatively, it feels different. Creative writing always feels like there could be something on the precipice. It is anticipatory, but what I am anticipating remains unknown. Sometimes something comes along, sometimes it passes on by.

A few days ago, I was reading Syllabus by #LyndaBarry the other day, and she wrote the following about the process of creating cartoon characters:

"I've never thought one up… I just draw and they seem to show up.… the way I knew they were characters was I felt my self wanting to copy them… A story starts to develop and I don't have to do very much except draw them again and try not to push things in any particular direction fro as long as I can stand to stay out of things, but eventually that open way changes and I start wanting from them. Expectation… stops the natural pace of discover and replaces it with an objective."

When I'm writing creatively, I can enter this flow state. The next thing that comes can – and often is – a surprise. Occasionally it actually stuns me, when a sentence or a description or a plot really come together in a way that feels both organic and unforced. (Revision is another story.)

I can never enter this flow state when writing a paper because I always come to the page with an objective. There is always a reason I am sitting down to write – e.g. to describe a figure, to report results, to discuss a method.

How do you access a flow state as an academic? I guess this is why it's useful to have all your figures made before you start writing. Your objective is a specific description, and when you have many items to describe (or discuss, or review), you can sort of hit your stride, knock off your points one by one.

Perhaps discussions can flow, and I just haven't written enough yet?
