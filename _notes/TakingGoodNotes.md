Perhaps part of the problem was that newer note-taking tools made it very easy to create new notes and even treat fragments of notes as linkable objects in themselves. Easy is good in general, but not if it helps you create _too much_ content without pausing to lay tracks for your future self.

Simply writing more focused titles has forced me to rethink the purpose of each note.
