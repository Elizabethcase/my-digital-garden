From #BraidingSweetgrass, thinking about relationships between people, the land.. struck me that when we "lose time" or when time "runs away from us" or when it speeds up or slows down.. we are treating it as it's own autonomous being. I like thinking of it this way â€“ it softens our relationship, from total personal responsibilty, to a congenial relationship: ofte we are there for each other, sometimes we are not. Can our language animate time, the same way some languages animate mountains?
