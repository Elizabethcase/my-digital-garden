People, art, stories, etc that I've found compelling, engaging and/or brilliant. Changes often & updated with new categories frequently

Currently recommending -- [The Japanese Citrus candle from Brooklyn Candle Co](https://brooklyncandlestudio.com/collections/bestsellers/products/japanese-citrus-minimalist-candle). If I could smell this all the time for the rest of forever, I would.
