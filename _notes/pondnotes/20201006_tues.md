Many more leaves this morning, though seemingly only where the trees are reflected. Some trick of the ligh, where the dark reflections highlight their brilliant outlines. Or just, the sky only shows in the southwest; anyways all reflections are at trick of the light and imagine if the trees grew across and not up. Would it look the same in the water? Almost a hint of blue in the white low clouds.
