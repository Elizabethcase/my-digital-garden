The water to the southwest is flat and glassy this morning, the muck green water muting fall colors: reds turned to wheatmeal, meyer-lemon yellows to umber, pine green to taupe, or [wenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millettia_laurentii). Closer to the window (the house is directly north of the pond, and the land has been cleared beyond for wetland restoration and cattle grazing), a breeze has caught the top of the water, blurring out the reflection into pixelated lines, like bits of magnet aligned to face northeast. 

One trunk, with particularly impeccable posture – an oak? – divides the pond into two. On the right, bright gray mid expansive sky. On the left, a beckoning forest [two children might find themselves having wandered into](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3718778/). 

Then, all is still, then, the surface moves slightly and the leaves look like they're moving with the wind, but the branches are still. An illusion? A reality? The truth is relative here.
