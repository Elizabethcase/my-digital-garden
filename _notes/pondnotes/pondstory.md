September 25

The pond shimmers in the morning light, tiny refracting waves reflecting light a thousand times again. Today the last of the summer heat lies in thick strips over treetops and flattens into the wetlands beyond. The pond drains into them. I have come here to figure out what drains me, and follow that drain down and through.

October 4

Today, the pond is a mossy, muddy green, the dull surface blurred by a thousand pinging rain drops, concentric ringing, refracting, and rebounding. On the western edge, bright yellow leaves fallen from the overhanging sugar maple anchor stillness to the beating water; in a gradient to the east, the leaves turn to salmon and then rust, soft, like clay and the sky at dusk. Why is the far southern edge churned, a concave line dividing smoother from rougher waters? Does the ground drop, or rise to just below the surface? 

I think the turtles that live in the pond are painted turtles. They spend their days crooning on a fallen branch that juts out from the overgrown bank. Wildflowers, thick grasses, cattails and woody reeds flush together, holding back the land, holding in the water, whispering soft stories to each other in the rain.

The pond to the southwest is flat and glassy this morning, muck green water muting fall colors: reds turned to wheatmeal, meyer-lemon yellows to umber, pine green to taupe, or [wenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millettia_laurentii). Closer to the window (the house is directly north of the pond, and the land has been cleared beyond for wetland restoration and cattle grazing), a breeze has caught the top of the water, blurring out the reflection into pixelated lines, like bits of magnet aligned to face northeast. 

One trunk, with particularly impeccable posture – an oak? – divides the pond into two. On the right, bright gray mid-expansive sky. On the left, a beckoning forest [two children might find themselves having wandered into](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3718778/). 

Then, all is still, then, the surface moves slightly and the leaves look like they're moving with the wind, but the branches are still. An illusion? A reality? The truth is relative here.

October 7 

Not two weeks ago I'd been staring at the pond with fullbody desire for immersion; the bitter chill of this morning powders that hope. I have never regretted swimming in cold water, but this one I feel I might. From one edge of the pond, brown leaves and the dark green sheen of the oak and the pines. From the other, where the sugar maples here just turned, the yellow brilliance overcomes even the turgid green and explodes in delight over the surface, the bright promise of fall – that bundled warmth, that sharp freshness, that feeling of hope despite winter's imminence. Or because of it? 

October 8
Many more leaves fallen this morning, though seemingly the leaves fell only where the trees are reflected. There are thirty or forty thousand leaves on a single mature maple. These numbers are unfathomable. We live an average of 22 million seconds, if each leaf is a second, that's only 550 trees. Barely a grove. The sky sits only in the southwest today. Everything else, brown.

October 9
On the surface of the pond, tight groups of oval bugs. Each time I through a pine cone into the water, they scatter when the ripple gets to them, which generates more ripples, and scatters more groups. Then they reform, but in smaller numbers. I hadn't seem them huddled like this until today. Another sign of the end times? I picked fresh mint fromt he edge of the pond. The oaks have still not tuned! The remain as if in summer – deep, well-oiled greens high up in their canopies.

October 11
Even while it rained again today, I could not help myself and went out to the floating dock and grabbed the big bamboo to push me off the bank. The sky hung heavy and low, a solid, emphatic stone. I laid back on the dock, a few fingers hanging off the dock, resting just above the water. The geese are migrating, family vees veering south towards warmer climates. I have always fled to the north. Once the chill started to settle around me, I sat up and sunk the bamboo pole toward the bottom to propel me back to the bank. It never hit. I could not find the bottom. I had before! I had before!

October 12
The pond looks dark and deep today, endless, sucking, like a hole drilled deep into the bottom of the ocean. The liquid that fills the space between the earth and the air seems thicker, viscous, too still to be water.The leaves, by contrast, spatter the reflection of the delineated sky, bands of mild grey and milder blues, like frozen flocks of starlings. The surface breathes, barely perceptible. A lot more silt than yesterday. Near the center, a single recoil of rings spreads out from beneath the water.

October 15
I saw a tiny turtle on the fallen branch yesterday, the size of a child's palm. It perched, without alarm, though also seemingly without rest. I haven't seen the other turtles in a while. The water is higher today, just as dark. 

October 16
The water's gone green, rough skinned.

I am renting this house from a young family with old dreams – restore the property, turn it into a farm. The pond was there to begin with. It doesn't really belong in this topography. Someone built it, to irrigate the cows. Someone built it, to water the chickens. Someone built it – the last owner was sure, but I am not so sure.

October 18
I  was finally working, or sitting at least, and out the window rapid fire commotion. A flock of sparrows, or some small birds, cawing like crows, burning gas away from the pond. The surface has been rippling for two days now. The southern wind pushes the leaves to the edge, creating a dead estuary converges. I can't see the trees bisecting the pond anymore, too much turbulence. Had I ever been able to see the bottom?

October 20
A storm blew in yesterday, an torrent of rain, a bluster, a fierce exuberance. I ran out into the winds, trees cracking overhead. Thunder hailed and the lightning cut. The pond pulsed, southern winds beating waves into the surface. One of the maples, still miraculously green, shuddered and swayed, then half of it cracked. The fall was slow, the landing abrupt, hard, and reverberating, just missing the small barn.

October 21
It took too long for those waves to subside. The water is so high it laps at the edges of my feet when I walk the dog in the morning. She did not want to go out this morning, whining at the door. The dog slinks away from the edge, toward the woods. The grass is saturated, the ground is saturated, mud, leaves, debris, stick to my boots and the dogs fine fur.

October 22
The pond has started to flood the grass. I don't know where the water is coming from. The highland cows have pushed toward the furthest edge of the pasture, into a corner with an electric fence and very little to eat.

October 25
I couldn't sleep last night. I heard the most beautiful music.

October 26
I woke up in the morning to my dog whining. My partner was gone, the side of his bed cooling rapidly in the morning brisk. I went to the window. Out where the pond was, a magnificent beast. You have to believe me that I saw this all in the sunlight. In the place of the pond was a large green toad. Water streamed down the sides of it's burled, mottled body. Thick-lidded eyes stared outwards and forward, the size and color of worn tires.  Its 
My partner climbed stared up at it from the ground. It reached out one webbed foot. He clambered up the stiff ramp that was also a leg, nestled into the fold, and was carried off as the toad hopped through the wetlands and into the forest, distanter and distanater.
