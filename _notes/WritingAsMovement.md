From #journal September 9, 2020

Lying on my yoga mat upstairs at Hatchery road, trying to stay still, impatient in Shivasana, I didn't feel the fabric until it moved. Writing is movement --> I am not aware of the idea until I write it. It exists. It's presence impacts and influences, but it's shape, existence, color, and texture remain vague or unnoticed until the idea moves, that is, until I begin to write.

Perhaps this also relates to my difficulty with math? Writing out equationsâ€¦ how does that offer exploration? I cannot build up enough momentum for the movement of math to reveal any insight. How do I build movement into math?
