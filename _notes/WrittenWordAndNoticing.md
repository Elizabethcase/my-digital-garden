Does the emphasis on (written) literacy cause us to notice less, in general? I mean the reader, not the writer. If we valued oral tradition int he same way as we value literacy, would we necessarily notice more, remember more? What does a technologically advanced civilization with a strong oral tradition look like? Are tech./scientific progress & oral tradition intrinsically at odds? How would you share complex information? Feels like oral tradition is inefficient wrt the spread of and democratic access to information? Is it? Can I imagine otherwise?
